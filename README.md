To run a STREAMLIT file open the Terminal in PYCHARM and run
streamlit run <python file name>

To install packages go to Packages on Pycharm and search for required package 
and Install.

This is being installed in the VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT - this means it has its
own python interpreter viz., 

C:/Users/sunde/AppData/Local/JetBrains/PyCharmCE2024.2/demo/PyCharmLearningProject/venv/Scripts/python.exe

I has its own set of packages. The file "requirements.txt" should have 
specific packages required for streamlit operation specified as:

<package name>==<version number>
